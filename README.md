## How to Run the App

To run the Blog Web Application, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies:**

    - First, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website.
    - Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

          python -m venv venv

    - Activate the virtual environment:

      - On Windows:

            venv\Scripts\activate

      - On macOS/Linux:

            source venv/bin/activate

    - Install the required dependencies by running:

          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - The requirements.txt file includes all the necessary libraries, such as Flask, scikit-learn, MySQL connector, and others.

2.  **Set Up MySQL Database:**

    - Create a MySQL database for the app. In the database folder, you will find SQL queries to create the necessary tables. Run the queries in your MySQL database.
    - Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and set up the variables. An example is provided in the .env.example file.

3.  **Run the Application:**

    - You can run the app directly from your IDE (such as PyCharm, VSCode, etc.) by running the main.py file.
    - Alternatively, you can run the app using Gunicorn for a production-ready setup:

          gunicorn main:app

      - This command will start the app using Gunicorn, which is a WSGI HTTP server for Python web applications.

4.  **Access the App:**

    - Once the app is running, the URL will pop up on the screen, allowing you to interact with the app.

5.  **Credentials:**

    - For admin access, use the following credentials:
      - Username: admin
      - Password: pass1

Thatâ€™s it! You can now start using the blog web application to read and post blogs.
